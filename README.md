## **✅ What These Docs Are**
- A good reference for the **basics of programming in FRC,** specifically using **Java.**
- An introduction to the various **software used in FRC** (WPILib, Motor Controller Configuration Tools, Miscellanious Flashing Software, etc.)
- A guide on installing and using **Pathplanner.**
- A reference to use when **troubleshooting the robot** and something just won't work.

## **❌ What These Docs *Aren't***
- **The best way to do things, just the way we as team 3939 do it.** Realistically, you shouldn't be doing things exactly the way they are laid out here, just **using them as a starting point.** But hey, if it works it works.
- **A Java tutorial**. It would be a good idea to learn the basics of Java before following along with these references.

?> If you have any questions about anything in the docs or you notice something is wrong, feel free to reach out to me on Snapchat if you already know me or at mmmspicy. on Discord. I'll probably pay attention to it!
