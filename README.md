## **✅ What These Docs Are**
- A good reference for the **basics of programming in FRC,** specifically using **Java.**
- An introduction to the various **software used in FRC** (WPILib, Motor Controller Configuration Tools, Miscellanious Flashing Software, etc.)
- A guide on installing and using **Pathplanner.**
- A reference to use when **troubleshooting the robot** and something just won't work.

## **❌ What These Docs *Aren't***
- **The best way to do things, just the way we as team 3939 do it.** Realistically, you shouldn't be doing things exactly the way they are laid out here, just **using them as a starting point.** But hey, if it works it works.
- **A Java tutorial**. It would be a good idea to learn the basics of Java before following along with these references.

?> If you have any questions about anything in the docs or you notice something is wrong, feel free to reach out to me on **mmmspicy. on Discord** or **Snapchat/Instagram** if you know me. I'll *probably* pay attention to it!

## 🛠️ How to Run These Docs Locally
 These docs run using [ **docsify**](docsify.js.org), a very nice site generator that can generate these pages using markdown. To quote their documentation:
- It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

!> *If npm is not recognized by your terminal, you will need to download it and Node.js [**following these instructions**](https://nodejs.org/en/download)*.

- [**Download this project**](https://github.com/frc-team3939/3939-Code-Docs) through GitHub, and you can either use `localrun.bat` to launch the docs or navigate to project folder with your terminal of choice and run:

```bash
docsify serve
```
- After a second, the terminal will prompt you to view the docs by visting [**localhost:3000**](localhost:3000) or something similar, it'll tell you.
